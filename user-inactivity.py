# This AWS Lambda script automates the management of IAM user access keys based on inactivity. It performs the following actions:

# Fetch IAM Users & Access Keys: Retrieves a list of all IAM users and their associated access keys.
# Evaluate Key Inactivity: Checks the last used date for each access key. If a key has been inactive for a specified number of days (DISABLE_IN_DAYS), it sends a warning. If the inactivity exceeds the threshold (DISABLE_IN_DAYS), the key is disabled. If inactivity surpasses DELETE_IN_DAYS, the access key is deleted, and the corresponding IAM user is removed.
# Notification: Sends notifications regarding the status of the userâ€™s access keys (Warning, Disable, or Delete) with detailed inactivity information.
# Environment Variables: Configurable thresholds for disabling and deleting keys are set through environment variables (DISABLE_IN_DAYS, DELETE_IN_DAYS, etc.)
# Workflow:
# IAM users are queried for their associated access keys.
# Last used date for each key is checked.
# Depending on inactivity, keys are either warned, disabled, or deleted.
# The script logs and notifies actions taken, based on the inactivity thresholds.
